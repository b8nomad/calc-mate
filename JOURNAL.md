## 10/21/2025 - i built the prototype image of how the keyboard will look.  

i'm building calc-mate.
it's a custom built calculator keyboard used in commerce.


the keyboard will be able to communicate 0-9 values and +, -, x, /, %, = operations.

attached is the image of it's prototype.

## 10/22/2025 - from fusion 360 to budgeting and understandin the components  

i started my research by installing fusion 360 software for 3d modeling. i learned basic features of the software, like creating objects, making holes in objects, merging objects, using assembly tools, applying fillets, chamfers, and a few other techniques and features.

secondly, i understood how keyboards and their circuits work.

i also explored different component marketplaces and retailers and chose sharvielectronics.com, which has all the equipment and hardware components i need for my project.

here’s the checklist of items and equipment i require:

_please criticize my checklist if there's any alternatives i should consider**_

i've added:

1. esp32 microcontroller with wifi and bluetooth support
2. oled display for showing battery health, connectivity status, and other fun things through firmware
3. copper wire, diodes, and ribbon wires for connecting the switches to the microcontroller (i’m not getting a custom pcb; i’m hand-wiring them)
4. 3.7v 2800mah rechargeable battery for wireless connectivity options
5. mt3608 step-up module for 5v output from the battery
6. m2.5 6mm mounting screws
7. m2.5 6mm brass inserts
8. a push button
9. other equipment like a soldering iron, hot air gun, and glue gun (i’m planning to remove some of these)


i also researched 3d printing materials, how they work, and how providers get the job done. specifically, i learned how to assemble and attach components with screws and brass inserts using a hot air gun and soldering iron.

lastly, today was a competitive day as i learned various things altogether.

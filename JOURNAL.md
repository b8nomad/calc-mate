## 10/21/2025 - i built the prototype image of how the keyboard will look.  

i'm building calc-mate.
it's a custom built calculator keyboard used in commerce.


the keyboard will be able to communicate 0-9 values and +, -, x, /, %, = operations.

attached is the image of it's prototype.

## 10/22/2025 5 PM - from fusion 360 to budgeting and understandin the components  

i started my research by installing fusion 360 software for 3d modeling. i learned basic features of the software, like creating objects, making holes in objects, merging objects, using assembly tools, applying fillets, chamfers, and a few other techniques and features.

secondly, i understood how keyboards and their circuits work.

i also explored different component marketplaces and retailers and chose sharvielectronics.com, which has all the equipment and hardware components i need for my project.

hereâ€™s the checklist of items and equipment i require:

_please criticize my checklist if there's any alternatives i should consider**_

i've added:

1. esp32 microcontroller with wifi and bluetooth support
2. oled display for showing battery health, connectivity status, and other fun things through firmware
3. copper wire, diodes, and ribbon wires for connecting the switches to the microcontroller (iâ€™m not getting a custom pcb; iâ€™m hand-wiring them)
4. 3.7v 2800mah rechargeable battery for wireless connectivity options
5. mt3608 step-up module for 5v output from the battery
6. m2.5 6mm mounting screws
7. m2.5 6mm brass inserts
8. a push button
9. other equipment like a soldering iron, hot air gun, and glue gun (iâ€™m planning to remove some of these)


i also researched 3d printing materials, how they work, and how providers get the job done. specifically, i learned how to assemble and attach components with screws and brass inserts using a hot air gun and soldering iron.

lastly, today was a competitive day as i learned various things altogether.  

## 10/22/2025 6 PM - rebranding  

first, i was thinking of building a fun mini-calculator keyboard.

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM2MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--10562a82e5e4b48b38e551e2abb5816cae978dc1/image.png)

but i thought to myself, we only get one chance. why to waste it on a boring keyboard? while i can make a big split keyboard that i can actually use.

soooo, introducing key-mate, a split-able keyboard that has 3 connectivity options.
just wanna game? use the first half. just wanna scroll some youtube reels? use the second half.

this time, i'll also require a pcb, so the learning curve is steeper (or should i hand-wire them? ðŸ‘€)

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c76e1d1461c8e7e1e84f0c989e4a5acb9ee69270/image.png)

this is a basic layout of my keyboard (looks very much like a mac keyboard)

https://keychron.in/product/double-shot-low-profile-pbt-keycap-full-keycap-set/

i loved these key caps, so maybe i'll use them and the keyboard layout should at final look something similar. (should i buy these? or 3d print my own custom?)
i'm also thinking of including a knob that is customizable.

https://meckeys.com/shop/accessories/keyboard-accessories/key-switches/hmx-cloud-switch/

as for the key switches, i'm planning to buy these blue clicky switches.

and i guess, i'll have to buy a better microcontroller that can handle the entire keys. (open for recommendations)  

## 10/25/2025 12 AM - setting up the pcb  

day didn't start well,
kinda wasted the first few hours debugging the software and libraries (they won't work idk why asdoausidhjouas)

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2af2babf15e339de14d4c8112f138905dea8c8be/image.png)


couldn't do much, but eventually sorted things up

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--aaa3aafe1f3a30b616852d6e707067748aec3992/image.png)

i worked on basic switch + diode matrix, first positioned them in the schematic editor. then, in the pcb editor
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTIyMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9d0abfca776fdf7a2e3a6695e05d991253c47190/image.png)

i had to do a few things multiple times, in order to get the correct thingy (cause, yes, i'm dumb)

finally, choosing a microcontroller (erm) another big task.
at last, i choose esp-32-s3.
cause it natively supports bluetooth and wifi, and since we need different controllers in the halves these behave the best in such circuits.

(i wanted to go with xiao-ble, but eh it only got 11 pins and i kinda need 7+6=13 pins atleast)

next, gonna work on routing and setting up battery supply + protection etcccc  

## 10/25/2025 5 PM - routing try x1  

wasted precious hours of my life being dumb.

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--be5be588ab29282743dfd6f2739cba2a356bb741/image.png)

i designed the pcb schematics last time, and now i was doing the pcb routing.
and pfftt.. i'm soo bad at it..

but either way, ima try again.

let's route again ðŸ˜”  

## 10/25/2025 6 PM - routing the pcb, pushing on git  

though painful, but the request kinda seems nice.

the 3d view of the pcb looks something like this:

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a6d9434176c8160c418f0b4c8ae008cb1f0249fd/image.png)
can't wait to unveil the pcb order (soon tm)


kicad project files are now pushed on github!!!!! yayyy!!
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a1c122d8d2528957efc1b0067c2d5029cd88edf3/image.png)

also, since there was enough space in the left side (mcu ofc) so i've added one more oled display.
